# Noten

Warning: This is a high school project, it is very inefficient and is full of code smells. This is also a prototype program, meaning that it will not function with user inputs other than the files provided. 

Noten is a program that takes in an image of sheet music and scans for the key signature and the relative position of notes to determine the pitch of the notes. Then, the progarm annotates the notes in alphabet notes (A, B, C, D, E, F and G) and outputs the annotated image. 

Unfortunately, all documentation was lost with the deletion of the student account by the education department.
